    * Delay (optional)
- There will be a GET endpoint that will return all the responses that have been added to the server.
- DELETE endpoint to remove a response from the server
- All control requests will be kept in a cache and not stored between restarts.
- Use IConfiguration for the unique identifier that can be passed in
