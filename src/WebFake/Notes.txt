How do I want this to work?

 - Ideally a user will do a post with a request body that looks like this:
    * HttpMethod
    * Url
    * Response
        * StatusCode
        * Body (optional)
        * Headers (optional)
        * ContentType (optional)
    * Delay (optional)

- There will be a GET endpoint that will return all the responses that have been added to the server.
- A GEt endpoint that will give all request that have been made to the server along with the body of the request.
- A DELETE endpoint that will clear all the responses and requests from the server.

- If a request is made that does not have an entry then NOT FOUND is returned

- All control requests will be kept in a cache and not stored between restarts.

- Run either in console or as docker container.    

- Use IConfiguration for the unique identifier that can be passed in


Completed
- Can pass in an ID or some identifier that will be used as the starting point for all the requests to control the fake server.
